      <div id="dogs">
        <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>
        <p>Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.</p>
        <p><img src="img/dog2.jpg" alt="An image of dog"></p>
        <p>Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.</p>
        <p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight.The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier.</p>
        <p><img src="img/dog3.jpg" alt="An image of dog"></p>
        <p>The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field.</p>
        <p>Being the most abundant carnivore, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves.</p>
        <p><img src="img/dog4.jpg" alt="An image of dog"></p>
        <p>Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet.</p>
        <p>The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties.

      <div id="cats">
        <p>The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.</p>
        <p><img src="img/cat1.jpg" alt="An image of cat"></p>
        <p>They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.</p>
        <p>Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.</p>
        <p><img src="img/cat2.jpg" alt="An image of cat"></p>
        <p>There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.</p>
        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.</p>
        <p>Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche.</p>
        <p><img src="img/cat3.jpg" alt="An image of cat"></p>
        <p>Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.</p>
        <p>They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.</p>

      <div id="turtles">
        <p>Turtles spend most of their lives in water.</p>
        <p>They are adapted for aquatic life, with webbed feet or flippers and a streamlined body.</p>
        <p>Sea turtles rarely leave the ocean, except to lay eggs in the sand.</p>
        <p><img src="img/tur1.jpg" alt="An image of turtle"></p>
        <p>Freshwater turtles live in ponds and lakes, and they climb out of the water onto logs or rocks to bask in the warm sun.</p>
        <p>Tortoises are land animals. Their feet are round and stumpy, adapted for walking on land.</p>
        <p><img src="img/tur2.jpg" alt="An image of turtle"></p>
        <p>They also dig burrows with their strong forelimbs, and slip underground when the sun gets too hot.</p>
        <p>Terrapins live on land and in water, usually in swamps, ponds, lakes and rivers.</p>
        <p><img src="img/tur2.jpg" alt="An image of turtle"></p>
        <p>Turtles are very adaptive and can be found on every continent, except Antarctica. Most turtle species are found in southeastern North America and South Asia.</p>
